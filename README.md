The repository contains background materials for data articles on European football cups, primarily a table with results dating back to 1955 and notebooks with analyses.

The match data is sourced from Wikipedia. Therefore, 100% accuracy cannot be guaranteed. Some columns are still in the process of being cleaned, for example, the score does not differentiate between actual scores and forfeited scores. However, with basic caution, interesting insights can be found in these data.
